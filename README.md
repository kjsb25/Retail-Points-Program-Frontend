# Sample frontend for a hypothetical retail points system

## Known existing issues

Points per month table doesn't sort chronologically or by username.
Accesibility issues (I like darkmode too much)
It'd be cool to flash cells that update, and maybe set up an interval for adding a random row. That'd simulate a more real world scenario.
